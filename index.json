I am interested in harnessing insight into molecular function to manipulate biology in cells, and for therapeutic discovery. I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and effective communication.\nIn my PhD research with Stephen P. Bell at MIT, I used single-molecule microscopy to discover how eukaryotic DNA helicases are deposited on DNA to ensure DNA replication is bidirectional. I discovered that a helicase-loader protein called the origin-recognition complex (ORC) performs a flip in order to recruit two copies of the eukaryotic DNA helicase in opposite orientations to one another.

Because of the computational overhead of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)-based MD simulations, especially together with density functional theory, predictions of reaction mechanism, and estimation of free-energy barriers have to be carried out within few tens of picoseconds. We show here that the recently developed temperature-accelerated sliced sampling method allows one to sample large number of CVs, thereby enabling us to obtain rapid convergence in free-energy estimates in QM/MM MD simulation of enzymatic reactions. Moreover, the method is shown to be efficient in exploring flat and broad free-energy basins that commonly occur in enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate this by studying deacylation and reverse acylation reactions of aztreonam drug catalyzed by a class-C β lactamase (CBL) bacterial enzyme. Mechanistic details and nature of kinetics of aztreonam hydrolysis by CBL are elaborated here. The results of this study point to characteristics of the aztreonam drug that are responsible for its slow hydrolysis.","tags":[],"title":"Mechanism and kinetics of aztreonam hydrolysis catalyzed by class-C β-lactamase: A temperature-accelerated sliced sampling study","type":"publication"}]
